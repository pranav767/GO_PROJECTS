	Long: `Task Tracker CLI is a command-line tool to manage your tasks efficiently.
It allows you to add, delete, and manage tasks with ease. You can mark tasks as done, in-progress, or to-do.
For example:

./task-tracker add "Buy groceries"
./task-tracker delete 1
./task-tracker mark-done 2
./task-tracker list
./task-tracker list done
./task-tracker list todo
./task-tracker list in-progress`,
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.

	err := rootCmd.Execute()
	if err != nil {
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

	rootCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
